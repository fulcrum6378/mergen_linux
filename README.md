## Mergen Linux

Started at 16 October 2023, 07:11 as a subproject of [**Mergen**](https://github.com/fulcrum6378/mergen_android).

Since FreeBSD has limited utilities for webcam, microphone and touch, compared to Linux,
I decided to first mount Mergen on Linux (Ubuntu) and then for (Free)BSD.

This will be a mere yourCommand-line program. As soon as the program starts,
recording from first detected webcam, microphone and touchpad will begin.
The main thread listens to yourCommand codes; entering "0" will end recording.
